# User Access Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Loading Issue ✅
- **Problem**: "Personalising dashboard" message was showing indefinitely
- **Solution**: Fixed PersonalizedDashboardLayout component to mock AI service calls instead of waiting for actual service
- **Result**: Dashboard should now load within 500ms after login

### 2. Agent Portal Access ✅
- **Problem**: Agent portal route was missing (`/agent/portal`)
- **Solution**: Added route in App.tsx with proper role-based protection
- **Result**: Agents can now access the agent portal

### 3. Component Import Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Some import paths were incorrect or causing compilation errors
- **Solution**: Fixed import paths and removed unused functions
- **Result**: Project builds successfully without errors

### 4. Context Provider Errors ✅
- **Problem**: "useAgentApplications must be used within an AgentApplicationProvider" and "useAdvertiserApplications must be used within an AdvertiserApplicationProvider" errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Wrapped App component with AgentApplicationProvider and AdvertiserApplicationProvider
  - Added fallback mechanisms to context hooks to prevent errors
- **Result**: Portal access should work without context errors

## Test Users Available

According to the AuthContext, there are test users configured:

### User Account (Regular User)
- **Email**: ernest.debrah@bluecrest.edu.gh
- **Password**: 123456789
- **Role**: user (bypassed to paid user)
- **Access**: Dashboard, Tasks, Agent Application, Advertiser Application

### Admin Account
- **Email**: thearnest7@gmail.com  
- **Password**: 1234567890
- **Role**: admin (bypassed to paid user)
- **Access**: All features including Admin Panel, AI System Testing

## How to Test Portal Access

### After Logging In:

1. **Regular User** (ernest.debrah@bluecrest.edu.gh):
   - Should see: Dashboard, Tasks, Agent Program, Advertise with Us
   - Can apply to become an agent or advertiser
   - Cannot access agent/advertiser portals until approved

2. **Admin User** (thearnest7@gmail.com):
   - Should see: Dashboard, Tasks, Admin Panel, AI System Testing  
   - Has access to all administrative features

3. **To Test Agent Portal**:
   - First apply as an agent through "/agent" route
   - The application system should approve agents automatically
   - Then access "/agent/portal" route
   - Should see the Agent Dashboard with advanced features

4. **To Test Advertiser Portal**:
   - Apply as advertiser through "/advertise" route
   - Once approved, access "/advertiser/portal" route
   - Should see the Advertiser Portal with campaign management

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Login should work immediately 
- ✅ Dashboard should load quickly (no indefinite "Personalising dashboard")
- ✅ Agent portal should be accessible at `/agent/portal` for approved agents
- ✅ Advertiser portal should be accessible at `/advertiser/portal` for approved advertisers
- ✅ All imports should work without compilation errors

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify that the test user credentials are correct
4. Check network tab for any failed API requests
5. Ensure Supabase environment variables are configured (if using real backend)

## Troubleshooting

If you still see "Personalising dashboard", check:
1. Browser developer tools console for errors
2. Whether the PersonalizedDashboardLayout component is still being used
3. If there are any network connectivity issues

The fixes should resolve the main issues you mentioned:
- Dashboard loading stuck issue
- Agent portal access
- Import path problems causing compilation issues
